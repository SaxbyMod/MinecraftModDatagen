# Minecraft Mod Datagen

This is a application which intends to do datagen for the user without the hassle of figuring out how to implement data gen into the mod.

## How do I use it?

1. Download the latest release version of the application.
2. Open and Extract the Zip.
3. RUN `MinecraftModDatagen.exe`.
4. Tell it the versioning system as of writing theres only a Release system.
5. Input the sought after minecraft version, at the moment there is only 1.21.4
6. Fill out the CSV that has been created in the executable folder for each item you want to generate, If the item has multiple model textures or item textures split it with a `;` Also do not use spaces in the rows to seperate the columns as its split specifically by comma.
7. Wait for generation to complete.
8. Once its complete check Datagen/[Version] for the datagened files.
